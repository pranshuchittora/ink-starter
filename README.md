## Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/pranshuchittora/ink-starter.git --depth=1

cd ink-starter

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

## Getting started with the workflow

The boilerplate comes with all the required dependencies. Which required zero configuration out of the box.

Apart from that it has typescript enable which helps you write robust code.

The source code goes inside the `src` directory which gets compiled to `js` in the `dist` directory.

### Real-time compiling

The typescript compiler support files watching which compiles the files as soon as they get changed, and emits errors in real time.

```bash
# To start typescript in watch mode
npm run watch
```
